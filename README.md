# CSE482HonorsProject

This repository contains the code and images
to run image classification using Google's Tesseract OCR Engine 
through Python. 

PyTesseract Installation and Documentation: https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/

This process includes the extraction of string data from the images 
using the PyTesseract package. This data is then used to train and test 
a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier as well as a Logistic Regression
classifier.

All preprocessing procedures are within the file Preprocessing.ipynb.
The utilization and results of the classifiers are within Results.ipynb.
Images can be found in the images folder, and the intermediate data is found
in the data folder.
